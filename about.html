            <p class="about-text">
                I am a teenager from the province of Bergamo and study IT at <a class="active"
                    href="https://www.itispaleocapa.edu.it/" target="_blank">ITIS P. Paleocapa</a>.
                Since childhood, I have been passionate about math and technology, anxiously waiting for the rare IT
                lessons every month.
                After receiving a scholarship for my last year of middle school, I chose to continue my studies in the
                IT field. I think I made the right decision
                because I am passionate about what I learn in school, and my favorite fields are programming,
                cybersecurity, home automation and network management.<br><br>

                Since the first year of middle school, I have annually participated in math and logic games organized by
                the school.
                In 2022 I reached the national finals of the
                <a class="active" href="https://www.accademiamatematica.it/giochi-matematici" target="_blank">Giochi
                    Matematici del Mediterraneo</a>,
                finishing 11th in my age category. For the past two years, I have also participated in the Computer
                Science and Cybersecurity Olympiad.
                In 2023, after passing the territorial selections, I had the opportunity to improve my skills in solving
                network, web, and software security challenges
                during a Training Camp at the ITC ILO Campus in Turin, thanks to <a class="active"
                    href="https://olicyber.it/" target="_blank">OliCyber</a>.
                In 2024 I did a two-week school internship as a programmer at the company
                <a class="active" href="https://www.sorint.com" target="_blank">SORINT.lab</a>.
                During this time I worked with developers to solve tasks, took training courses, and created this
                website.
                It was a meaningful experience because it allowed me to apply the knowledge I gained in school and
                understand how a professional work environment operates.<br><br>

                I am a big fan of football, which I have played for 11 years. I love going to the stadium to cheer for
                my team
                and I follow statistics and international transfer market with interest.
                I'm also a console gamer, who prefers sports games like FIFA and NBA2K, as well as action-adventure
                games like Assassin's Creed and Marvel's Spider-Man.
                Besides sports and video game interests, I love to go to the cinema with my friends and follow TV series
                on streaming platforms,
                which are a real addiction for me. Musically, I mainly listen to hip-hop, rap and trap, and going to
                concerts of my favorite artists
                is one of the experiences that excites me the most.
